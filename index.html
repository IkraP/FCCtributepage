              Her sister offered her to stay in Paris, with the intention that
              she will study at the university. Marie jumped at the opportunity
              and went to study physics and mathematics at Sorbonne University.

              In France, she met her husband, Pierre Curie, who was the
              professor of the School of Physics. They married in 1895.

              The Curies became researchers at the School of Chemistry and
              Physics working on radioactivity. They built upon the pioneering
              work of Professor Henry Becquerel who discovered the new
              phenomenon of invisible radiation emitted from uranium.

              Marie discovered that the mineral, pitchblende, was more
              radioactive than pure uranium. Further work indicated that uranium
              alone was not the sole reason for the radioactive readings,
              therefore, indicating a new element was present in the sample.<br />
              They discovered a black powder, that was 330x more radioactive
              than uranium. In July 1898, the Curies announced the discovery of
              the new chemical element, polonium.<br />
              Upon further inspection, the remaining liquid found after polonium
              was extracted, was still extremely radioactive, even more so than
              polonium. The Curies then published evidence that a potential new
              chemical element had been discovered, which they called radium.

              After extensive work in trying to obtain a sample of this new
              element, Marie finally managed to isolate radium. The Curies were
              awarded, with Henry Becquerel, the Nobel Prize for Physics in
              1903.

              Pierre's death from a carriage, saw Marie take up her late
              husbands teaching post. This was a historical event, as this was
              the first time a woman was teaching at Sorbonne University.

              Marie's health started deteriorating and sadly on the 4th July
              1934, she died from leukaemia caused by the high level of
              radiation exposure
